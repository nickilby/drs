# How the AI/ML-Driven VM Placement Optimizer Decides Suitable Hosts

## Overview

The VM Placement Optimizer uses a sophisticated multi-criteria decision-making system to determine the most suitable hosts for VM placement. It considers compliance rules, performance metrics, resource efficiency, and operational factors to provide ranked recommendations.

## Decision-Making Process

### 1. Multi-Criteria Scoring System

The optimizer evaluates each potential host using three weighted criteria:

#### Compliance Score (40% weight in full version, 60% in simplified)
- **Anti-affinity rule violations**: Heavily penalized (-0.5 score)
- **Affinity rule violations**: Moderately penalized (-0.3 score)
- **Existing violations**: Penalized based on count (-0.2 per violation)
- **Dataset/pool placement rules**: Considered for storage placement

#### Performance Score (35% weight in full version, 40% in simplified)
- **CPU utilization**: Prefers <60%, penalizes >80%
- **Memory utilization**: Prefers <70%, penalizes >85%
- **Network utilization**: Prefers <60%, penalizes >80%
- **Storage I/O**: Prefers <60%, penalizes >80%
- **VM interference**: Lower score = better performance
- **Historical trends**: Bonus for consistently good performance

#### Resource Efficiency Score (25% weight in full version)
- **Resource balance**: Prefers balanced CPU/Memory/Network utilization
- **Utilization variance**: Lower variance = better score
- **Optimal utilization**: 30-70% range preferred
- **Storage capacity**: Considers available storage

### 2. Step-by-Step Decision Process

For each potential host, the system:

1. **Resource Capacity Check**
   - Verifies host can accommodate VM's CPU requirements
   - Checks available memory capacity
   - Validates storage space availability
   - Confirms network bandwidth adequacy

2. **Compliance Rule Evaluation**
   - Runs anti-affinity checks (e.g., "no two WEB servers from same alias on same host")
   - Runs affinity checks (e.g., "all DB servers from same alias should be on same host")
   - Checks dataset placement rules
   - Counts existing compliance violations on the host

3. **Performance Analysis**
   - Analyzes current utilization metrics
   - Reviews historical performance trends
   - Calculates VM interference patterns
   - Predicts performance impact of placement

4. **Efficiency Calculation**
   - Evaluates resource balance across CPU/Memory/Network
   - Calculates utilization variance
   - Determines optimal resource distribution
   - Estimates migration costs

5. **Score Calculation**
   - Applies weighted scoring formula
   - Generates detailed reasoning
   - Provides performance impact predictions

### 3. Example Decision Analysis

#### Scenario: Placing Web Server VM

**VM Requirements:**
- CPU: 4 vCPUs
- Memory: 8GB
- Alias: z-example-alias
- Role: WEB

**Host A (esxi-03) Analysis:**
```
Compliance Check:
- No existing WEB VMs with same alias ✓
- No anti-affinity violations ✓
- No existing violations on host ✓
- Compliance Score: 0.7 (good)

Performance Check:
- CPU: 30% (excellent) ✓
- Memory: 40% (excellent) ✓
- Network: 35% (excellent) ✓
- VM count: 6 (low density) ✓
- Performance Score: 0.94 (excellent)

Overall Score: (0.7 * 0.6) + (0.94 * 0.4) = 0.796
```

**Host B (esxi-02) Analysis:**
```
Compliance Check:
- Has existing WEB VM with same alias ✗
- Anti-affinity violation detected ✗
- Has 2 existing violations ✗
- Compliance Score: 0.1 (poor)

Performance Check:
- CPU: 75% (moderate) ⚠️
- Memory: 80% (moderate) ⚠️
- Network: 65% (moderate) ⚠️
- VM count: 12 (moderate density) ⚠️
- Performance Score: 0.63 (moderate)

Overall Score: (0.1 * 0.6) + (0.63 * 0.4) = 0.312
```

**Result:** Host A is recommended (score 0.796 vs 0.312)

## Key Decision Factors Explained

### 1. Compliance Rules (Highest Priority)

#### Anti-Affinity Rules
- **Purpose**: Prevent single points of failure
- **Example**: Two WEB servers from same alias shouldn't be on same host
- **Check**: Are there other VMs with same alias and role on this host?
- **Penalty**: -0.5 score if violation detected

#### Affinity Rules
- **Purpose**: Ensure related VMs are placed together
- **Example**: All DB servers from same alias should be on same host
- **Check**: Are there VMs with same alias and role on different hosts?
- **Penalty**: -0.3 score if violation detected

#### Dataset/Pool Rules
- **Purpose**: Control storage placement
- **Example**: VMs must be placed on specific datasets or pools
- **Check**: Does the host have access to required storage?
- **Penalty**: Varies based on rule type

### 2. Performance Metrics

#### CPU Utilization
- **<60%**: No penalty (optimal)
- **60-80%**: -0.1 penalty (moderate)
- **>80%**: -0.3 penalty (high)

#### Memory Utilization
- **<70%**: No penalty (optimal)
- **70-85%**: -0.1 penalty (moderate)
- **>85%**: -0.3 penalty (high)

#### Network Utilization
- **<60%**: No penalty (optimal)
- **60-80%**: -0.05 penalty (moderate)
- **>80%**: -0.2 penalty (high)

#### VM Interference
- **Calculation**: Based on VM density and performance correlation
- **Impact**: Higher interference = lower performance score
- **Formula**: `interference_score = min(vm_count / 20.0, 1.0)`

### 3. Resource Efficiency

#### Resource Balance
- **Purpose**: Prefer hosts with balanced resource utilization
- **Calculation**: Variance between CPU/Memory/Network utilization
- **Formula**: `balance_score = max(0, 1 - variance * 2)`

#### Optimal Utilization
- **30-70%**: Perfect score (1.0)
- **<30%**: Underutilized (score = utilization/0.3)
- **>70%**: Overutilized (score = max(0, 1 - (utilization - 0.7) / 0.3))

## Advanced Features

### 1. Historical Performance Analysis
- Analyzes 7 days of performance data
- Identifies performance patterns and trends
- Uses machine learning to predict future performance
- Considers seasonal patterns and workload variations

### 2. VM Interference Detection
- Analyzes performance correlation between VMs
- Identifies resource contention patterns
- Calculates interference scores based on VM density
- Considers workload characteristics and resource requirements

### 3. Migration Cost Estimation
```
Migration Time = Base Time × Network Factor × Storage Factor

Base Time = VM Memory (GB) × 1 minute/GB
Network Factor = max(0.5, min(2.0, 1000 / bandwidth))
Storage Factor = max(0.5, min(2.0, 5 / latency))
```

### 4. Performance Impact Prediction
- Estimates new CPU utilization after placement
- Predicts memory utilization changes
- Forecasts CPU ready time increases
- Estimates memory ballooning effects

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Prometheus Metrics
The optimizer leverages existing Prometheus metrics:
- `cpu.usage.average`
- `mem.usage.average`
- `net.usage.average`
- `disk.usage.average`

### Database Integration
Uses the existing MySQL database schema:
- `hosts` table for host information
- `vms` table for VM placement
- `metrics` table for performance data
- `clusters` table for cluster relationships

### Rules Engine Integration
Integrates with the existing compliance rules engine:
- Uses `evaluate_rules()` for compliance checking
- Considers all rule types (anti-affinity, affinity, dataset, pool)
- Maintains compliance during optimization

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: Production Web Server Placement

**VM Details:**
- Name: z-example-alias-WEB3
- Alias: z-example-alias
- Role: WEB
- Requirements: 4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM, 100GB storage

**Existing Infrastructure:**
- esxi-01: 45% CPU, 55% memory, 8 VMs, 0 violations
- esxi-02: 75% CPU, 80% memory, 12 VMs, 2 violations (has WEB2)
- esxi-03: 30% CPU, 40% memory, 6 VMs, 0 violations
- esxi-04: 85% CPU, 90% memory, 15 VMs, 1 violation
- esxi-05: 60% CPU, 65% memory, 10 VMs, 0 violations

**Decision Process:**

1. **esxi-02 Eliminated**: Anti-affinity violation (WEB2 already there)
2. **esxi-04 Eliminated**: Insufficient resources (85% CPU, 90% memory)
3. **Remaining Candidates**: esxi-01, esxi-03, esxi-05

**Final Ranking:**
1. **esxi-03**: Best performance (30% CPU, 40% memory), good compliance
2. **esxi-05**: Good performance (60% CPU, 65% memory), good compliance
3. **esxi-01**: Good performance (45% CPU, 55% memory), moderate compliance

**Recommendation**: esxi-03 with detailed reasoning and impact predictions
